## How to use the sample

1. Click on the 1 in the SketchWidget to start adding points to the map.
2. Each point will have an index number associated with it that displays on top of each circle graphic.
3. The symbol being used is a [CIMSymbol Cartographic Information Model](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-symbols-CIMSymbol.html)
4. After adding the CIM symbols to the Map, you can hover over the symbols to highlight the symbols
5. The highlighting is taken care of using the [hitTest](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-MapView.html#hitTest) method of the [MapView](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-MapView.html).
